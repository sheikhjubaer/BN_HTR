(**N.B.:** We only need the images and their annotations/groundtruths provided here in the Test portion. And to know how our system functions visually use the code provided for single image output transition with our Test images as the code requires annotations/groundtruths for result comparison.)<br/><br/>

(**N.B.:** If you need to test with your own dataset, please download the provided link and set your dataset in that particular format)<br/><br/>

[*To generate output for any datasets with multiple images, GPU is highly recommended! But just to see the output transition for single image, GPU is not mandatory.*]
